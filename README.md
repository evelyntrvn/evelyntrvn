# Hi! I'm Evelyn ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying computer science and minoring in data science and management information systems.

Currrently, I am looking for full-time jobs in software development with an interest in frontend and UX. I love how I can be both creative and logical with the problems that software development offers. I also enjoy being able to provide great experiences for the people that get to use my code and designs.
